# TDD Example

The specification is: write a function that takes a string and returns an object of the words and the number of times they are used in that string.

Further specifications are:

- an empty string will return an empty object
- a string must only use english words - punctuation and numbers are ignored
- words must be lowercase

Note: you can use this regex: `/[^ ]+/g` to split a string.
